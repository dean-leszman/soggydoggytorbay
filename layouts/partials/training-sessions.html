                    <p>Training sessions can vary from dog to dog. We recommend bringing high-value treats (e.g.
                        chicken/cheese/etc.) to these appointments as this engages your dog's brain more when giving them
                        their favourite treat.</p>
                    <p>While some dogs only need the odd session, others may need more frequent
                        sessions. </p>

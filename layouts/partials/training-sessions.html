                    <p>Training sessions can vary from dog to dog. We recommend bringing high-value treats e.g.
                        chicken/cheese/etc. to these appointments as this engages the dogs brain more with giving them
                        their favourite treat.</p>
                    <p>While some dogs only need the odd session, others may need more frequent
                        sessions. </p>

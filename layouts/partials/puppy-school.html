                    <p>We recommend puppies coming in from as early as 2 weeks after their 2nd jab. From 4 months old,
                        puppies tend to enter the "fear" stage of their life where certain things can become very scary.
                        By being accustomed to the environment and equipment, there is less chance of them developing a
                        fear or becoming aggressive during grooming.</p>
                    <p>Don't panic if your puppy is a little bit older. This can be started at any age! We recommend
                        under 6 months for the best results but this is available for dogs up to 1 year old.</p>

                    <p>A generic teeth clean can be done using a dog-friendly brush and doggy toothpaste. This is great
                        for dogs who
                        don't have much buildup of plaque and for owners who want to keep on top of their dog's dental
                        hygiene.</p>
                    <p>This is finished off with a dog-friendly breath spray.</p>
                    <p><small>This can be done as a standalone service or an optional extra added onto a groom.</small>

                    <p>An advanced teeth clean is performed with an ultrasonic toothbrush designed to target underneath
                        the plaque and help lift it away leaving a nice, clean tooth behind. This method can help reduce
                        inflammation, redness, fight against bacteria, and reduce smelly breath.</p>
                    <p>This can sometimes take a couple of sessions but is highly recommended for dogs with a buildup on
                        their teeth.</p>
